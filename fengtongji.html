                        <p>Hello, my name is Fengtong Ji. I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical and Automation Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, B.E. (Elite Class, Honours School), and M.E. from Harbin Institute of Technology. Then I continued my research on living active matter and collective microrobot at The Chinese University of Hong Kong as a Postdoctoral Fellow. I also attended a Summer Program at the Isreal Institute of Technology in 2013.</p>
                        <p>Now I am concentrating on promoting developmental mechanics and microrobotic engineering, aiming at developing interdisciplinary paradigms to extend the state of the art. I am also good at conducting simulations and theoretical analyses. The love of science and technology motivates me to explore the unknown world under microscopes, and this life-long march can only proceed with your collaboration. I hope we may have significant advances in our research.</p>
