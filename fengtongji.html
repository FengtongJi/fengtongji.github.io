                            <p>Hello, my name is Fengtong Ji. I received my PhD in Mechanical and Automation Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, M.E. (Distinction) and B.E. (Elite Class, Honors School) from the Harbin Institute of Technology. Then I continued my research on living active matter and collective microrobots at The Chinese University of Hong Kong as a Postdoctoral Fellow. I also attended a Summer Program in Mechanical Engineering at the Technion Israel Institute of Technology in 2013. The background is a piece of the night sky in the town where I was born.</p>
                            <p>Now I am concentrating on promoting developmental mechanics and microrobotic engineering at Cambridge, aiming at developing interdisciplinary paradigms to better understand embryonic development and to improve our healthcare system. The longing for knowledge motivates me to explore the world under microscopes, and I am committed to this life-long march to the unknown for the meaning of life and the betterment of humankind. Real science takes time, and patience is the key. Hope we may have significant advances in our research for the wonderful future.</p>
