                            <p>Hello, my name is Fengtong Ji. I received my PhD in Mechanical and Automation Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Then, I continued to study living active matter and collective microrobots there as a Postdoctoral Fellow. Now in <a href="https://www.xionglab.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Fengzhu Xiong's lab</a> at the Gurdon Institute, I am using nanorobotic engineering approaches to study developmental mechanics. Cells transform and travel to targeted locations and miraculously formulate functional tissues. What does this journey look like? What are the physical decisive factors of cell behaviours? Why do cells and tissues perform such dynamics? To answer these questions, I am trying to enhance our comprehension of development in a physical view and venture further to the unknown in the microenvironment in pursuit of the fate of life. Scientific discoveries take time, and patience is the key. The background is a piece of the night sky of the Plough in my hometown. Have a try to find the seven stars!</p></p>
